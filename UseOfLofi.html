            <h2>The Science behind Lofi </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Lofi has been known to be used as a studying type of music but why? Well, based on science and <br>
                experimentation on many different fronts, Lofi has been seen to reduce stress and improve <br>
                productivity. The elements that contribute to this are the jazzy instruments, the distinct <br>
                sound of the constant drum beat and the environmental sounds. It also acts as  an effective <br>
                stimulant. It has a balance of engaging and non-distracting sounds that give you the music you <br>
                love yet, it is so simple that it does not side-track your mind and keeps you focused in a <br>
                closed-in environment.

            <h2>How to Use This</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                So, how can you use this to your advantage? Depending what you are doing you can listen to lo fi <br>
                music to be more productive in whatever you are doing. For example, let’s say you are a student <br>
                needing to study. However, you have a problem with staying focused and think there is no possible <br>
                way you can do all that studying. Well, grab some headphones or speakers, put on a lofi soundtrack <br>
                and work your way through. You’ll find that this time it was easier to work. By using this music, <br>
                you in a way block out all distractions in your environment, keeping yourself more focused <br>
                (make sure to get rid of your phone out of sight). However, not all tasks are suitable for Lofi. <br>
                So make sure that you use it properly.
