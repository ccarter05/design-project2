            <h2>What is Lo-fi?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                According to Masterclass.com, “Lo-fi, or lofi, refers to a recording with less than professional <br> 
                or flawed sound quality. “Lo-fi” is short for “low fidelity,” and initially referred to a low-quality <br>
                recording with audible imperfections, such as background noise or performance mistakes” (Masterclass.com). <br> 
                Lo-fi is in simple terms music that has purposeful mistakes or imperfections that make the music more nostalgic <br>
                or de-stressing.

            <h2>Why people like lofi</h2>
            <br>
            <p> 
                Lofi is a unique genre of music that most people don’t know. It is, however, getting popular <br>
                in streaming. The music is so relaxing and simple that more and more people are starting to <br>
                love it even more. The music has a distinct sound and experimental nature that people love. <br>
                It is very much like what is called low-fidelity. It has background sound that other popular <br>
                songs would remove such as rain, fire, wind, footsteps, etc. It welcomes the imperfection in a <br>
                way that pleases the listener's ears. It has also become popular as a studying tool (later explained).
