                Hi there! My name is Callum and I am the creator of this website. <br>
                I am a high school student at St Thomas High School in <br>
                Pointe-Claire in my 3rd year of high school. This website was <br>
                inspired by one of my biggest passions; Lofi of course! <br>
                This website was a coding project for my Design coding Ib <br>
                elective course. I hope you enjoyed it. I am a hardworking student <br>
                aspiring to become something in life. I cherish the experiences I <br>
                can have and hope to promote a friendly environment for all <br>
                that I work with. I have lots of work experience in landscaping <br>
                and tree work because of my fatherâ€™s tree company. I hope I can <br>
                make future projects like this.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="contact-me">
            Thank you for visiting my website! Hope you liked it. If you have any questions  
            <br> on Lofi or would just like to contact me, email me at ccarter05@lbpearson.ca.
