            <h2>History</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                The history of Lofi is very interesting. Lofi was first created when Youtube debuted live stream <br>
                channels on their platform in 2013. Lofi artists began creating their own Lofi playlists and <br>
                streaming services on youtube. One of the most notable pioneers and artists of Lofi was Nujabes <br>
                and J. Dilla. It all started with Nujabes’ soundtrack for the anime series Samurai Champloo in <br>
                2004. That is the reason why many Lofi playlist are connected to anime and animated film series. <br>
                Another popular artist is ChilledCow (which is now called Lofi Girl). In his debut in 2015 he was <br>
                able to lead Lofi forward almost acting as a Lofi hip-hop radio station with over 7.5 million <br>
                subscribers and 13,000 hours of listening after only two years have passed! That’s how Lofi <br>
                became a popular genre of music through Youtube.
